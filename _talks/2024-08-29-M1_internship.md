This presentation was given after a 3+ months internship under L. Varnet at the Laboratoire des Systemes Perceptifs, DEC, Ecole Nationale Superieure, PSL. It was about Tone-in-Noise detection by the human auditory system, and the replication of a pioneering study for Signal Detection Theory, to test a brand new toolbox developped by the lab. This 15 minute-talk was followed by a Q&A session, and was given in front of teachers and students (graduates and newcomers).
