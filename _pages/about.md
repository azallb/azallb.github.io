Hi ! I'm Azal and this page was designed to organize and showcase my work, mostly academic, cumulated over the course of my studies, and details about my research so far. <br>
You can find old blog articles on my sound-related [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/melomanelibre/) (now inactive), also available by clicking the Facebook icon on the sidebar.

About Me
======
I'm a 22 year-old post-graduate engineering student from Paris, France. I'm specializing in psychoacoustics, hearing, neurosciences, and speech comprehension. <br> 
I will be graduating in September 2025 from my Master 2 called "[ATIAM](http://www.atiam.ircam.fr/en/)" (standing for "Acoustics, Signal Processing and Machine Learning for Music" in French). This Master program is hosted by [Ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/), [Sorbonne University](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home). <br>
In 2024, I graduated from my Master 1 degree in Mechanical Engineering, Acoustics branch at [Sorbonne University](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en). During this year, I have won a prize for curriculum excellence and future work prospects, given by Sorbonne and its Retired Researchers Group (see French page : [Prix des Anciens 2023](https://anciens.sorbonne-universite.fr/index.php/prix-des-anciens)). <br>
In 2023, I graduated from my Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science with 2:1 Honours, still at Sorbonne. <br>
In 2020, I got my French Scientific Baccalaureate with the Highest Honours (First Class) from the [Lycee Jean de la Fontaine](https://pia.ac-paris.fr/serail/jcms/p2_73053/fr/accueil). <br>
During those years, I have completed 3 internships (see CV header for more info). The last one in date is on-going with the [Auditory Cognition Group](https://www.auditorycognition.org/) (UCLondon & Newcastle, UK, and Iowa, US). For 5+ months, I am working with the UK branch in England under Pr. T.D. Griffiths on speech-in-noise perception, listening effort and pupillometry & microsaccades as indicators of said effort. The last fully completed internship was in 2024 under L. Varnet at the [Laboratoire des Systemes Perceptifs](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en/presentation-487), ENS-PSL, France. It was about tone-in-noise detection and replicating a pionneering study from the 70s using a brand new toolbox.

More Facts And Frolics
======
1. I've been interested in auditory perception for more than 3 years, in sound physics for 8, in music for 15, and in human behaviour for my entire life.
1. My 2nd most important hobby, after studying people, is music ! I've been singing my whole life, but I also play the bass and sometimes the guitar. I have performed at some concerts and it was the best experience of my life every time. I also listen to at least 2h of music per day.
1. I write a lot : from novels to poems, sometimes even movie scripts... I write at least once a day, and I have a never ending urge to write.
1. I love and dabble in most arts like drawing, painting, sculpting... I need to put my hands on medium any time I can.
1. I have studied many languages : I am fluent in French and English, but studied Japanese as my 2nd language for 7 years in secondary school, and Italian as my third at the same time for 5 years. I am currently learning Persian (Farsi) and LSF (French Sign Language). My next languages of interest are Finnish, Swedish, German and Mandarin. I dream of learning every language I can to help my understanding of diverse cultures and communities.
1. I love the outdoors and being active : you'll either find me bouldering or hiking on the weekends. And I have tried almost every sports, I never say no to trying out new activities.
