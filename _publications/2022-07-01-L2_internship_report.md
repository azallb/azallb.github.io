Abstract : In the field of acoustical engineering, modeling in the continuous medium is necessary to be able
to understand all dynamical phenomena. The subject of this internship was the study of acoustical
sources, with the following goals :
- understanding the acquisition chains for sound signals and their spectrograms
- making sure that the system is operational for data adequacy
- establishing the directivity diagrams for all sound sources
This results in directivity modeling after setting up the acquisition chains depending on the sources,
the acquisitions themselves and data processing.
To process signals and study them with precision, perfect performance of the microphones is mandatory.
In this context and to check it, I coded a program which we will talk about later.
Because the microphones were operating correctly, the precision of the directivity diagrams by beamforming
was ensured, which allowed us to study them accordingly. Beamforming is a fundamental
technique in antenna engineering. The details of its relationship with signal processing will be explained
along the way.
Finally, the contents of the experiments done during the internship and their results are detailed in
the corresponding sections of this report.
