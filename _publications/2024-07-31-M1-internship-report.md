Abstract : This internship focused on the detection of a pure tone in noise by the human auditory system and the cues used for this detection. For this study, Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and psychoacoustic reverse‑correlation methods (revcor) were employed. With the goal of replicating one of the foundational works in SDT and revcor, we reproduced the study “Time and Frequency Analyses of Auditory Signal Detection” by Albert Ahumada et al. (1975), which investigated tone‑in‑noise detection. Nine participants completed the experiment as described in the 1975 paper. Their data were collected using the Matlab fastACI toolbox (Osses & Varnet, 2021), processed, and analyzed. These results were then compared to those obtained with Green’s energy‑detector model, and all findings were contrasted with the original 1975 study’s outcomes. Additionally, since time permitted, a new auditory system model was implemented, and its results were compared with the previous ones.
